The `@` symbol typically represents the root directory of the project. Let's examine the file structure to determine the correct paths.\n\nFrom the file tree, we can see that `homeData.ts` and `DemoCard.tsx` are located in the `components` directory. Therefore, the correct import paths should be `components/homeData` and `components/DemoCard`.\n\nI will now update the `index.ios.tsx` file with the correct import paths.\n\nOkay, I already have the content of `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.ios.tsx`.

I will proceed by creating the `app/meet-now.tsx` file with a placeholder and then address the linting error.\n\nSince I cannot directly create files, I will provide the code for `app/meet-now.tsx` here, and you will need to create the file in the project.\n\n```typescript\n// app/meet-now.tsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { View, Text, TextInput, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { useRouter } from 'expo-router';\n\nexport default function MeetNowScreen() {\n  const router = useRouter();\n  const [person, setPerson] = useState('');\n  const [type, setType] = useState('');\n\n  const handleFind = () => {\n    console.log('Find midpoint with:', { person, type });\n    router.back();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Text style={styles.title}>Meet in the Middle</Text>\n\n      <Text>Who are you meeting?</Text>\n      <TextInput\n        style={styles.input}\n        placeholder=\"Ex: Mom, Sarah, Chris\"\n        value={person}\n        onChangeText={setPerson}\n      />\n\n      <Text>Type of meetup</Text>\n      <TextInput\n        style={styles.input}\n        placeholder=\"Ex: Coffee, Meal, Marketplace Sale\"\n        value={type}\n        onChangeText={setType}\n      />\n\n      <Button title=\"Find Midpoint\" onPress={handleFind} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    padding: 24,\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: 22,\n    fontWeight: '700',\n    marginBottom: 24,\n  },\n  input: {\n    borderWidth: 1,\n    marginBottom: 12,\n    padding: 8,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNow, let's address the UI changes for the home screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`). I will provide the updated code here:\n\n```typescript\n// app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';\nimport { useRouter } from 'expo-router';\n\nexport default function HomeScreen() {\n  const router = useRouter();\n\n  const handleFindMidpoint = () => {\n    router.push('/meet-now');\n  };\n\n  const handleSafeMeet = () => {\n    router.push('/meet-now?safeMeet=true'); // Pass safeMeet flag\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Text style={styles.header}>MidPoint</Text>\n      <Text style={styles.subtitle}>Meet in the middle.</Text>\n\n      <Button title=\"Find the Midpoint\" onPress={handleFindMidpoint} />\n      <Button title=\"Safe Meet\" onPress={handleSafeMeet} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'center',\n    alignItems: 'center',\n    padding: 20,\n    backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0', // Cleaner background\n  },\n  header: {\n    fontSize: 32,\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    marginBottom: 8,\n  },\n  subtitle: {\n    fontSize: 16,\n    marginBottom: 24,\n  },\n  button: {\n    borderRadius: 8, // Rounded buttons\n    marginVertical: 8,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nKey changes:\n\n*   Added header and subtitle.\n*   Replaced the single button with \"Find the Midpoint\" and \"Safe Meet\" buttons.\n*   Added basic styling for layout and appearance.\n*   The \"Safe Meet\" button now passes a `safeMeet=true` query parameter to the `/meet-now` route.\n\nNext, I will modify the `MeetNowScreen` to handle the \"Safe Meet\" mode and implement the contact selector.\nSince I cannot read the newly created `app/meet-now.tsx` file, I will proceed with modifying the code based on the previous version I provided.\n\nHere's the updated `app/meet-now.tsx` code:\n\n```typescript\n// app/meet-now.tsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet, Platform, ScrollView } from 'react-native';\nimport { useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'expo-router';\nimport * as Contacts from 'expo-contacts';\n\nexport default function MeetNowScreen() {\n  const router = useRouter();\n  const { safeMeet } = useSearchParams();\n  const [selectedContact, setSelectedContact] = useState(null);\n  const [contactsList, setContactsList] = useState([]);\n  const isSafeMeet = safeMeet === 'true';\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    (async () => {\n      const { status } = await Contacts.requestPermissionsAsync();\n      if (status === 'granted') {\n        const { data } = await Contacts.getContactsAsync({\n          fields: [Contacts.Fields.Name, Contacts.Fields.PhoneNumbers, Contacts.Fields.Image],\n        });\n\n        if (data.length > 0) {\n          setContactsList(data);\n        }\n      }\n    })();\n  }, []);\n\n  const handleFind = () => {\n    console.log('Find midpoint with:', { selectedContact, safeMeet });\n    if (isSafeMeet) {\n      // TODO: Filter midpoint suggestions to only include public locations\n      console.log('Safe Meet mode is ON. Filtering public locations...');\n    }\n    router.back();\n  };\n\n  const renderContactItem = (contact) => (\n    <Button\n      key={contact.id}\n      title={contact.name}\n      onPress={() => setSelectedContact(contact)}\n    />\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <View style={styles.container}>\n      <Text style={styles.title}>Meet in the Middle</Text>\n\n      {isSafeMeet && <Text style={styles.safeMeetIndicator}>Safe Meet ON</Text>}\n\n      <Text>Select Contact:</Text>\n      <ScrollView style={styles.contactListContainer}>\n        {contactsList.map(renderContactItem)}\n      </ScrollView>\n\n      <Button title=\"Find Midpoint\" onPress={handleFind} disabled={!selectedContact} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    padding: 24,\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: 22,\n    fontWeight: '700',\n    marginBottom: 24,\n  },\n  safeMeetIndicator: {\n    color: 'green',\n    marginBottom: 12,\n  },\n  contactListContainer: {\n    marginBottom: 12,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nKey changes:\n\n*   Imported `expo-contacts` and used `useEffect` to request permissions and load contacts.\n*   Implemented a simple contact list using `ScrollView` and `Button` components.\n*   Used `useSearchParams` to get the `safeMeet` parameter from the URL.\n*   Added a \"Safe Meet ON\" indicator.\n*   Added a placeholder comment for filtering midpoint suggestions in `handleFind`.\n*   Disabled the \"Find Midpoint\" button until a contact is selected.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   This code requires the `expo-contacts` package to be installed.\n*   The contact list implementation is basic. A more sophisticated UI (e.g., iOS-style list) would require more complex code.\n*   The midpoint filtering logic is a placeholder. You'll need to implement the actual filtering based on your backend and data.\n\nNow, I will address the linting error.\n\nI apologize, I do not have access to the `search` tool. However, based on my knowledge and the error message \"Unable to resolve path to module 'expo-contacts'\", the most likely cause is that the `expo-contacts` package is not installed or the import statement is incorrect.\n\nGiven the code I've provided, the correct import statement is:\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Contacts from 'expo-contacts';\n```\n\nTherefore, the solution is to ensure that the `expo-contacts` package is installed in the project. You can install it by running the following command in your project directory:\n\n```bash\nnpx expo install expo-contacts\n```\n\nAfter installing the package, the linting error should be resolved.\n\n**Summary of Actions:**\n\n1.  **Create `app/meet-now.tsx`:** Create the file with the code I provided.\n2.  **Update `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:** Update the home screen code with the code I provided.\n3.  **Update `app/meet-now.tsx`:** Update the meet-now screen code with the code I provided.\n4.  **Install `expo-contacts`:** Run `npx expo install expo-contacts` in your project directory.\n\nAfter completing these steps, the app should have the updated UI, the \"Safe Meet\" functionality, and the contact selector. The linting error should also be resolved.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-07T18:28:37.843679"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you update the MidPoint app UI.
